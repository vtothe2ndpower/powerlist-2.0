# The Power List 2.0
I created this application so that I could build something more substantial with the full MERN stack. I used Redux for state management throughout the application to track any changes, and to get more practice with the technology. You must be logged in and authenticated to make changes in the running list and the data will persist in the database until a user makes any changes to it. Lots of working parts to this full-stack application despite it being rather simple functionality-wise.

*Technologies Used: React, Redux, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, Authentication (JSON Web Tokens)*

*NOTE: This is deployed with Heroku so the page load speed may be pretty slow. Please give the application a few seconds to get up and running.*
